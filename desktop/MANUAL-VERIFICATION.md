# 31-A manual verification (Windows)

The automated `npm run test:e2e` proves the shell launches and renders the bundled
frontend. The items below need **real Google OAuth + a real Windows machine** and
cannot run in CI — verify by hand on Windows before marking 31-A Done.

**One-time setup (external):**
1. In Google Cloud Console → the existing OAuth **Web** client, add `http://localhost:5180` to **Authorized JavaScript origins** *and* **Authorized redirect URIs** (the app serves itself on `http://localhost:5180`; `redirect_uri = window.location.origin`).
2. Build with the client id baked in: `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<id> npm run build`, then `npm start`.

| # | Given / When / Then | Pass? |
|---|---------------------|-------|
| 1 | Given a first launch, When I click **Sign in with Google**, Then the Google consent/sign-in completes **inside the app window** (no external browser hand-off) and my notes list loads from the **prod API**. | ☐ |
| 2 | Given I am signed in, When I **quit and relaunch** the app, Then I am still signed in — no re-consent (the `rt` refresh-token cookie persisted in the Electron session). | ☐ |
| 2a | **Cookie mechanism (load-bearing):** after sign-in, confirm the `rt` cookie is actually **stored and replayed** — the `Secure` cookie must survive on `http://localhost`. If sign-in works but step 2 fails, this is the cause (DevTools → Application → Cookies → `http://localhost:5180`). | ☐ |
| 2b | **Sign-in redirects stay on localhost:** during sign-in, if the window ever lands on `https://note-taker-ai.com/...` instead of returning to `http://localhost:5180`, an `/api` redirect wasn't rewritten — note the URL. | ☐ |
| 3 | Given the app is running, When I check the loaded notes, Then they are my real prod notes (confirms the bundle calls the live prod API, not a stub). | ☐ |
| 4 | Given CloudFront is unreachable (e.g. block its host), When I launch, Then the shell **still renders** (assets are local) — only live API calls fail. | ☐ |

Record the build SHA shown on launch (31-A AC: stamp the bundled commit) next to the result.
